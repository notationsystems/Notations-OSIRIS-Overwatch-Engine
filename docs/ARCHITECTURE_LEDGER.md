# OSIRIS — Architecture Ledger & Repository Intelligence

Running record of what was studied, what was decided, and why. Every adaptation
answers: *why does this belong in OSIRIS, and what existing capability does it extend?*

## Substrate reconnaissance (osiris-palantir-dashboard)

**What OSIRIS already provided:** Next.js 16 + React 19 + Tailwind 4; MapLibre GL
globe (`OsirisMap.tsx`) with a fixed set of GeoJSON sources updated via `setGeo()`
per-layer effects; `LayerPanel` with grouped, capability-gated toggles; a dashboard
shell (`page.tsx`) polling ~70 API routes into a `dataRef`; panel chrome conventions
(glass panels, mono type, HUD tags); vitest with colocated tests; Docker/deploy.

**Directly extended (not forked):** the economy subsystem reuses the exact map
pattern (new sources + layers + `setGeo` effect + delegated click handlers), the
LayerPanel group format, the layer-aware fetch pattern, panel chrome, and the
route-per-capability API convention. Zero existing behavior changed; `page.tsx`
baseline lint error count unchanged.

**Genuine gaps filled:** no canonical state, no provenance discipline, no graph,
no analytics, no commodity data. All added under `src/lib/economy/*` — see
`docs/PHYSICAL_ECONOMY.md`.

## Curated repository studies

### OSINT-War-Room (FastAPI + Leaflet overwatch dashboard)
- **Strongest ideas:** per-domain thin proxy/normalizers with a uniform
  `{status, data}` envelope; request coalescing (`_cache` + `_pending` events);
  graceful source-degradation ladders (GDELT 15-min feed → daily CSV fallbacks);
  sequenced map boot with a real progress overlay; layout persistence with
  validation; layer-cardinality-derived threat meter; single-timer relative
  timestamps; bbox-scoped fetching from map bounds.
- **Decision:** *Adapt (later)* — the coalescing + degradation-ladder patterns fit
  OSIRIS's route layer when live providers arrive. *Rejected:* global mutable
  singletons, client-side API keys, unescaped `innerHTML` for scraped text,
  JSON-file-as-database, and above all its fictional elements (scripted "radio
  transcripts", casualty counters derived from article-count proxies) — simulated
  and sourced data must never share a surface. That rejection is enforced in
  OSIRIS by valueKind/provenance discipline.

### commodity-market-simulator (C++ order-book toy)
- **Strongest ideas:** parse/execute split (fully validated command before any
  state mutation); command-table registry; per-item partial-failure batching.
- **Decision:** *Reference only.* Its core inversion lesson — results as
  machine-readable state, not display text — is baked into the engine
  (`AnalyticalResult` objects, never strings). *Rejected:* closed int-enum
  commodity registry, unit-less quantities, float money.

### storm-engine (Sea Dogs C++ DX9 engine)
- **What it is:** Core façade singleton; generational entity manager with 32
  layered execute/realize passes; string-keyed attribute trees with change
  events; bespoke script VM; quadtree-LOD sea renderer; weather as a parameter
  block driving all renderers; baked coarse lookup rasters.
- **Decision:** *Adapt the architecture, not the code.* Direct reuse is
  impossible (DX9/Win32, no WASM path, no shared language) and its per-subsystem
  equivalents are superseded in the web stack (MapLibre tiling ≈ LOD; typed
  state ≈ attribute trees). What OSIRIS took is the **engine shape**: a core
  lifecycle (acquire → index → systems pass → project) with registered,
  independent systems — implemented in `src/lib/economy/engine.ts` — and the
  event-driven loop (event → state change → propagation → projection) in
  `propagation.ts`. The one pattern held in reserve: Storm's weather/time
  parameter block as a future shared "scenario clock" driving map atmosphere and
  temporal playback coherently. A native Storm-based 3D world view could one day
  *consume* OSIRIS projections over HTTP, but it is a separate client, not a
  substrate for this codebase.

## Capability gap analysis (post-phase-1)

| Capability | Now | Gap | Path | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Canonical state + provenance | ✅ copper | more commodities | new curated/live adapters; state model needs no change | high |
| Live acquisition | ❌ | trade stats, exchange stocks, AIS | implement `EconomyAdapter` against live providers, reuse War-Room coalescing/degradation patterns | high |
| Time-series state | partial (inventory series) | flows/production over time | `period` already on every record; add series storage + temporal UI | high |
| Graph UI | ❌ (server traversal + panel trees only) | visual graph exploration | `react-force-graph-2d` already a dependency; feed it `view=state` | medium |
| Scenario analysis | seed (propagation system) | flow rebalancing, what-if | new engine system; registry makes this additive | medium |
| Search over entities | ❌ | find "Escondida" from the search bar | extend existing `SearchBar`/geosearch with econ entities | medium |
| Alerting | ❌ | anomaly → LiveAlerts | feed `anomalies`/`propagation` results into existing alerts panel | low |

## Verification

Every subsystem above ships with executable tests (47 economy tests; 407 total
passing). Build, lint (new modules clean; substrate baseline unchanged), and a
Playwright smoke run against the production server verified the end-to-end
research workflow, including screenshots of the map layers, research panel and
entity inspector.
