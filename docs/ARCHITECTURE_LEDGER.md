# OSIRIS — Architecture Ledger & Repository Intelligence

Running record of what was studied, what was decided, and why. Every adaptation
answers: *why does this belong in OSIRIS, and what existing capability does it extend?*

## Substrate reconnaissance (osiris-palantir-dashboard)

**What OSIRIS already provided:** Next.js 16 + React 19 + Tailwind 4; MapLibre GL
globe (`OsirisMap.tsx`) with a fixed set of GeoJSON sources updated via `setGeo()`
per-layer effects; `LayerPanel` with grouped, capability-gated toggles; a dashboard
shell (`page.tsx`) polling ~70 API routes into a `dataRef`; panel chrome conventions
(glass panels, mono type, HUD tags); vitest with colocated tests; Docker/deploy.

**Directly extended (not forked):** the economy subsystem reuses the exact map
pattern (new sources + layers + `setGeo` effect + delegated click handlers), the
LayerPanel group format, the layer-aware fetch pattern, panel chrome, and the
route-per-capability API convention. Zero existing behavior changed; `page.tsx`
baseline lint error count unchanged.

**Genuine gaps filled:** no canonical state, no provenance discipline, no graph,
no analytics, no commodity data. All added under `src/lib/economy/*` — see
`docs/PHYSICAL_ECONOMY.md`.

## Curated repository studies

### OSINT-War-Room (FastAPI + Leaflet overwatch dashboard)
- **Strongest ideas:** per-domain thin proxy/normalizers with a uniform
  `{status, data}` envelope; request coalescing (`_cache` + `_pending` events);
  graceful source-degradation ladders (GDELT 15-min feed → daily CSV fallbacks);
  sequenced map boot with a real progress overlay; layout persistence with
  validation; layer-cardinality-derived threat meter; single-timer relative
  timestamps; bbox-scoped fetching from map bounds.
- **Decision:** *Adapt (later)* — the coalescing + degradation-ladder patterns fit
  OSIRIS's route layer when live providers arrive. *Rejected:* global mutable
  singletons, client-side API keys, unescaped `innerHTML` for scraped text,
  JSON-file-as-database, and above all its fictional elements (scripted "radio
  transcripts", casualty counters derived from article-count proxies) — simulated
  and sourced data must never share a surface. That rejection is enforced in
  OSIRIS by valueKind/provenance discipline.

### commodity-market-simulator (C++ order-book toy)
- **Strongest ideas:** parse/execute split (fully validated command before any
  state mutation); command-table registry; per-item partial-failure batching.
- **Decision:** *Reference only.* Its core inversion lesson — results as
  machine-readable state, not display text — is baked into the engine
  (`AnalyticalResult` objects, never strings). *Rejected:* closed int-enum
  commodity registry, unit-less quantities, float money.

### storm-engine (Sea Dogs C++ DX9 engine)
- **What it is:** Core façade singleton; generational entity manager with 32
  layered execute/realize passes; string-keyed attribute trees with change
  events; bespoke script VM; quadtree-LOD sea renderer; weather as a parameter
  block driving all renderers; baked coarse lookup rasters.
- **Decision:** *Adapt the architecture, not the code.* Direct reuse is
  impossible (DX9/Win32, no WASM path, no shared language) and its per-subsystem
  equivalents are superseded in the web stack (MapLibre tiling ≈ LOD; typed
  state ≈ attribute trees). What OSIRIS took is the **engine shape**: a core
  lifecycle (acquire → index → systems pass → project) with registered,
  independent systems — implemented in `src/lib/economy/engine.ts` — and the
  event-driven loop (event → state change → propagation → projection) in
  `propagation.ts`. The one pattern held in reserve: Storm's weather/time
  parameter block as a future shared "scenario clock" driving map atmosphere and
  temporal playback coherently. A native Storm-based 3D world view could one day
  *consume* OSIRIS projections over HTTP, but it is a separate client, not a
  substrate for this codebase.

## Phase 2 — live acquisition, temporal state, graph exploration (delivered)

Source reconnaissance ran as a parallel probe workflow from inside this
sandbox; every adapter below was built against endpoints proven reachable and
parseable here, with verbatim response captures committed as snapshots:

| Source | Verdict | Adapter |
|---|---|---|
| UN Comtrade public preview | works, no key; physical kg incl. bilateral rows; strict per-IP rate limits | `comtrade-trade` (world totals; per-request snapshot degradation on 429) |
| USGS MCS World Data CSV (ScienceBase) | works; REPORTED production/reserves by country | `usgs-mcs-live` |
| Yahoo HG=F chart API | works with browser UA; monthly USD/lb 10y | `yahoo-copper-price` |
| CFTC COT (Socrata) | works, no key; weekly positioning (dataset ids inverted vs docs: 72hh-3qpy = disaggregated) | `cftc-positioning` |
| WB Pink Sheet xlsx | works ($/mt monthly since 1960) but xlsx parsing + hash discovery | deferred (Yahoo covers price) |
| LME/SHFE stocks | no free API confirmed | not built — stock series stays representative |

Patterns adapted from the OSINT-War-Room study now live in code: the
degradation ladder and in-flight coalescing wrap every live adapter (reusing
the substrate's own `sourceCache`), and "never mix simulated and sourced data"
became the reported>estimated>representative evidence ranking in
`observationsAt`.

## Phase 3 — external review findings (all shipped)

An external review of the phase-2 branch produced four findings; disposition:

1. **Granularity overlap** — flagged as urgent double-counting. Verified NOT
   live: `concentration()` restricts each calculation to one entity kind, so
   facility and country populations never mix (now pinned by a regression
   test). The review's by-product shipped as the `coverage` system: rolled-up
   facilities ÷ direct country observation — the coverage denominator (Chile
   45%, DRC 22%, Indonesia 73% modeled).
2. **Divergence as evidence** — shipped as the `divergence` system + the
   `Divergence` derived record + bilateral (partner-scoped) observations from
   Comtrade partner rows. First run surfaced the Chilean concentrate
   reporter-suppression mirror gap (~4x) and the DRC→China −25% gap.
3. **Point-in-time correctness** — shipped before any alerting work: `knownAt`
   + `supersedes` on observations, `firstReportedAt` + detection latency on
   events, the MCS2024 vintage ingested alongside MCS2025, and
   `knowledge=as_known_then` through engine, API and UI (HINDSIGHT/AS KNOWN
   toggle on the scrubber). Verified live: mid-2024 as-known-then serves
   MCS2024's Chile estimate (5,000 kt), best-known serves MCS2025's reported
   revision (5,250 kt).
4. **Epistemic classes** — `measurementClass` with enforced invariants:
   concentration refuses price/positioning; the roll-bearing HG=F series is
   excluded from anomaly detection; positioning anomalies are tagged reflexive
   market context; reserves stay a stock, never throughput.

## Phase 4 — basis correctness + scenario (external review round 2)

The round-2 review caught that phase 3's top-ranked divergence (Chile→China
"suppression", 75%) was a units artifact: the 3.97× ratio implies 25.2% Cu —
dead center of the concentrate grade band — i.e. contained metal on one side,
gross weight on the other. Shipped in response:

- **QuantityBasis** (`cu_content`/`gross_weight`/`unspecified`) on
  observations and flows; the graph refuses gross-weight flows as throughput
  (pinned by test), so mixed bases can never skew propagation shares.
- **Grade-band basis gate** in divergence classification: ratios in 3.0–5.0×
  on concentrate mirrors class `definitional` with the implied grade named;
  `unexplained` is now the hardest class to earn. The DRC→China refined gap
  (basis cannot be the mechanism at 99.99% Cu) correctly retains it and now
  ranks first.
- **coverageBias** attached to the facility-level HHI: modeled-coverage range
  (currently 22–100% by country) travels with the number.
- **Scenario system**: counterfactual event injection through the same engine
  on an explicit EvaluationFrame (kind/scenario/asOf/knowledge — knowledge in
  the run fingerprint, so a disagreeing replay can distinguish "the baseline
  moved" from "we know more now"). POST /api/economy/scenario returns
  baseline + counterfactual + structural delta. The as-known-then replay test
  demonstrates the backtest: Grasberg's dependent-smelter conclusion is
  reachable with contemporaneous knowledge, and posing the event two days
  earlier recovers the same conclusion.

## Capability gap analysis (post-phase-2)

| Capability | Now | Gap | Path | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Canonical state + provenance | ✅ copper | more commodities | new curated/live adapters; state model needs no change | high |
| Live acquisition | ✅ 4 providers | bilateral trade flows as graph edges; LME stocks | allocation model for country↔facility flow reconciliation; paid/licensed stock feeds | medium |
| Time-series state | ✅ (decade series, asOf engine, playback UI) | time-resolved flow tonnage | quarterly/annual flow snapshots per period | medium |
| Graph UI | ✅ force-graph explorer | path analysis, community detection | operate on the existing `view=graph` payload | medium |
| Scenario analysis | seed (propagation system) | flow rebalancing, what-if | new engine system; registry makes this additive | high |
| Search over entities | ❌ | find "Escondida" from the search bar | extend existing `SearchBar`/geosearch with econ entities | medium |
| Alerting | ❌ | anomaly → LiveAlerts | feed `anomalies`/`propagation` results into existing alerts panel | low |

## Verification

Every subsystem above ships with executable tests (47 economy tests; 407 total
passing). Build, lint (new modules clean; substrate baseline unchanged), and a
Playwright smoke run against the production server verified the end-to-end
research workflow, including screenshots of the map layers, research panel and
entity inspector.
